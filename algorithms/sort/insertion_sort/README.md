# Insertion Sort

Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array
one item at a time by comparisions. It is much less efficient on large lists than more
advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort or merge sort.

## Complexity

**Space complexity:** O(1)

**Time complexity:**

|  Best  | Average |  Worst  |
|:------:|:-------:|:-------:|
| O(n)   | O(n^2)  | O(n^2)  |
